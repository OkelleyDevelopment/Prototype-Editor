# Prototype Editor

## Motivation

For one of my course projects, I needed something with similar functionality. That prototype is what lead to not only this
fun little prototype for another project. But it helped me figure out what CodeMirror is capable of doing
and thereby, helped me with my course work.

## Prereqs

- npm
- A browser

## Program Execution

```
npm install
```

Then open the `index.html` in a browser; I used FireFox.


## Bugs

- None that affect UI
